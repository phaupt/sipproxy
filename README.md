SIP Proxy - Security Penetration Test Tool 
====

In the so called "Proxy Mode", the application acts as a proxy between a VoIP PBX and a UA (VoIP hard- or softphone). 
SIP traffic can be sniffed and dynamically manipulated with the help of regular expressions. 
Logged SIP messages can be modified and resent.

In the "Test Case Mode" predefined security tests which are specified as XML files can be run against a specific target. 
Fuzzing technology, which is a kind of black-box testing, can be applied to find weak spots in VoIP devices. 
There are many more specific modules which can be used within such a test case. For example Wordlist- or Bruteforce attacks.

While running a test case, feedback is given by displaying a grahical report which can be exported afterwards in a printable PDF document.
